## Hi & Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first webpage. This was created using CSS and HTML

**Aim**
The aim of this project was to create a responsive webpage that showcases my skills, hobbies and how to contact me  

**What I learnt**

- In this project, I learnt how to create different classes and divs

- I understood the differences between `padding` `margin` and `border`  and their importance in a webpage

- I learnt how to insert a fav icon and google font to my HTML page

- I also learnt how to insert footer links and buttons


**My TakeHome**

- In this project, understanding the right `font-size` `padding` `margin` `color` and `line-height` to use for all the divs was very important. Sometimes it might take a little bit of research and trials to finally get what you need.

- This was a fun project for me. I learnt a lot about CSS styles
