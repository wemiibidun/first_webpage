## Lessons Learnt

- In this project, I learnt how to create different classes and divs

- I understood the differences between `padding` `margin` and `border`  and their importance in a webpage

- I learnt how to insert a favicon and google font to my HTML page

- I also learnt how to insert footer links and buttons



## My Take Home

- In this project, understanding the right `font-size` `padding` `margin` `color` and `line-height` to use for all the divs was very important. Sometimes it might take a little bit of research and trials to finally get what you need.

- This was a fun project for me. I learnt a lot about CSS styles
